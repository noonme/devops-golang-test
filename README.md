# devops-test
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/devops-test:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/devops-test:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/devops-test:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/devops-test/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

# DevOps开发 golang 测试

1. 72小时内完成
2. fork本仓库
3. 通过kubebuilder或者手动创建golang的项目；完成自定义CRD MyStatefulSet核心功能的开发（功能同kubernetes StatefulSet），尽可能的完善！
4. 同时还需要实现ValidatingAdmissionWebhook，为MyStatefulSet提供准入验证
5. 要求不能直接引用kubernetes StatefulSet模块源码
6. 单元测试覆盖率必须大于80%，提交PR的时候，请附带上单元测试覆盖率截图或记录
![alt text](image.png)
7. 必须包含controller、AdmissionWebhook部署需要helm chart
8. makefile包含完整的编译流程（controller、AdmissionWebhook镜像的编译、helm chart编译、单元测试）
9. 完成以后通过pull request 提交，并备注面试姓名+联系方式，然后即时联系HR以免超时；

谢谢合作
